<h2>1. Purpose, Scope, and Definitions</h2>
<p>This document sets forth the Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>") under which the website <strong>ethanytangcodes.github.io</strong> (the "<strong>Site</strong>") is offered by its operator, <strong>Ethan Tang</strong> (the "<strong>Operator</strong>"). These Terms apply to all visitors, users, browsers, agents, and any other party that accesses or interacts with the Site in any manner (each a "<strong>User</strong>").</p>
<div class="definitions" aria-labelledby="definitions-heading">
<h3 id="definitions-heading">Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Site"</strong> — the website located at <em>ethanytangcodes.github.io</em> and all content, pages, files, services, and features made available therefrom.</li>
<li><strong>"Operator"</strong> — the individual or entity that operates the Site, currently and solely <strong>Ethan Tang</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>"User"</strong> — any person or entity that accesses, views, interacts with, downloads from, or otherwise uses the Site for any purpose.</li>
<li><strong>"Content"</strong> — all text, images, code, examples, tutorials, downloads, design elements, and other materials published or made available on the Site, whether original or sourced from third parties with license.</li>
<li><strong>"Unauthorized Activity"</strong> — any use of the Site that contravenes these Terms, applicable law, or accepted digital conduct, including but not limited to hacking, scraping, unauthorized copying, and redistributing content without attribution.</li>
<li><strong>"Redistribution"</strong> — public sharing, copying, reposting, or otherwise making Content available to persons or systems beyond the direct consumption by a User; redistribution requires attribution as described herein.</li>
<li><strong>"You" or "Your"</strong> — references to the User accessing or using the Site.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="muted">These definitions clarify terms used throughout these Terms and will control their interpretation unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Elaboration:</em> By defining terms thoroughly, the Operator ensures that Users clearly understand rights, responsibilities, and limitations before accessing the Site. This reduces misunderstandings and clarifies the scope of the agreement.</p>
